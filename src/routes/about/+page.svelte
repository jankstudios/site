    <h5>What is Jank?</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Jank is a design practice that makes objects and sells them online. Jank "products" are half practical, half art. I just make cool things that make me happy :)</p>
    <br>
    <p>-------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <h5>How does Jank design products?</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Jank products follow a continuous development, continuous iteration cycle. Instead of releasing "Skateboard 1", "Skateboard 2", and "Skateboard 3", Jank will release "Skateboard", and improve on that product over time. This means the skateboard you get in 2027 will have slight improvements over the 2025 skateboard, despite being the same model.</p>
    <br>
    <p>-------------------------</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Where are Jank products made?</h5>
    <br>
    <p>I make everything by hand from my garage in New Jersey. Materials are sourced globally. I would love to be 100% made in USA in the future though.</p>
